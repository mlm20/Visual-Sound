# Hardware in the loop and embedded computing

## Background
- When we think of computers we think of PCs/laptops with screens etc.
- Most computers are much less visible, e.g. fridge, car, etc.
- They are *embedded systems*, the software they run is called *embedded software*
- There is a vision of technology that is very connected to the physical world (e.g. IoT, Industry 4.0, etc.)
    - These are all *cyber-physical systems*

## Single board computers
