# Tutorial 2



## Task 1 : RGB LED

- LED tutorial was followed
- Subsequently the task set was completed using the following code, the LEDs functioned as expected

```c++
//www.elegoo.com
//2016.12.8v

// define pins
#define BLUE 11
#define GREEN 12
#define RED 13

void setup()
{
  pinMode(RED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(GREEN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(BLUE, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(RED, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(GREEN, LOW);
  digitalWrite(BLUE, LOW);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// define variables
int redValue;
int greenValue;
int blueValue;

// main loop
void loop()
{
  #define delayTime 200 // fading time between colors

  // initialise LED values
  redValue = 255;
  greenValue = 0;
  blueValue = 0;

  // increase green values
  for (greenValue = 0; greenValue < 255; greenValue += 17)
  {
    // increase blue values
    for (blueValue = 0; blueValue < 255; blueValue += 17)
    {
      analogWrite(GREEN, greenValue);
      analogWrite(BLUE, blueValue);

      Serial.print("(");
      Serial.print(redValue);
      Serial.print(",");
      Serial.print(greenValue);
      Serial.print(",");
      Serial.print(blueValue);
      Serial.print(")");
      Serial.print("\n");
      
      delay(delayTime);
    }

    Serial.print("(");
    Serial.print(redValue);
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.print(greenValue);
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.print(blueValue);
    Serial.print(")");
    Serial.print("\n");
    
    delay(delayTime);
  }
}
```



## Task 2 : Controlling servos

The servo was setup as per the instructions. The following code was used to complete task 2:

```c++
//www.elegoo.com
//2018.12.19
#include <Servo.h>
/* After including the corresponding libraries,
   we can use the "class" like "Servo" created by the developer for us.
   We can use the functions and variables created in the libraries by creating 
   objects like the following "myservo" to refer to the members in ".".*/

Servo myservo;
//it created an object called myservo.
/*  you can see Servo as a complex date type(Including functions and various data types)
    and see myservo as variables.               */

void setup(){
  /*"attach" and "write" are both functions,
     and they are members contained in the complex structure of "Servo". 
     We can only use them if we create the object "myservo" for the complex structure of "Servo".
  */
  myservo.attach(9);//connect pin 9 with the control line(the middle line of Servo) 
  myservo.write(90);// move servos to center position -> 90°
} 
void loop(){
  myservo.write(90);// move servos to center position -> 90°
  delay(1000);
  myservo.write(180);// move servos to center position -> 60°
  delay(1000);
}
```



## Task 3 : Controlling DC Motors

The motor and keypad were set up as described in the instructions. Task 3 was completed and it worked as expected. The following code was used:

```c++
#include <Keypad.h>

#define ENABLE 12
#define DIRA 10
#define DIRB 11
 
void setup() {
  //---set pin direction
  pinMode(ENABLE,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(DIRA,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(DIRB,OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Initialise motor speed
  analogWrite(ENABLE,255);
  digitalWrite(DIRA,HIGH); //one way
  digitalWrite(DIRB,LOW);
}

// Keypad setup
const byte ROWS = 4; //four rows
const byte COLS = 4; //four columns

// Define the two-dimensional array on the buttons of the keypads
char hexaKeys[ROWS][COLS] = {
  {'1','2','3','A'},
  {'4','5','6','B'},
  {'7','8','9','C'},
  {'*','0','#','D'}
};
byte rowPins[ROWS] = {9, 8, 7, 6}; //connect to the row pinouts of the keypad
byte colPins[COLS] = {5, 4, 3, 2}; //connect to the column pinouts of the keypad

// initialize an instance of class NewKeypad
Keypad customKeypad = Keypad( makeKeymap(hexaKeys), rowPins, colPins, ROWS, COLS); 


// Variables

int i = 0;                      // Variable to know the position in the sequence of a pressed number
int int_customKey = 0;          // Variable to get the integer value of the pressed number
int in_pass = 0;                // The current password being introduced
int power[3] = {100, 10, 1};    // Array to get the result of 10^(2-i) when computing the integer value of the password being introduced
  
void loop(){
  char customKey = customKeypad.getKey();
  
  if (customKey){
    if (i < 3){                                   // If i < 3, more numbers to complete the password are needed
      int_customKey = customKey - '0';            // Obtaining the integer value of the pressed button. ASCII code of the pressed button minus ASCII code of character '0'.
      in_pass = in_pass + int_customKey*power[i]; // Computing the integer value of the password being introduced
      i = i+1;                                    // A button has been pressed, so the position in the sequence for the next number is updated
      Serial.print('*');                          // Sending character '*' for the serial monitor
    }
  if (i >= 3) {                                    // If i >= 3, a full password has been introduced. Time to check!
     Serial.println();
     if (in_pass <= 255) {                             // Is the inputted speed valid?
       // Console Log
       Serial.println("Motor speed has been set to ");
       Serial.print(in_pass);

       // Set PWM to inputed number
       analogWrite(ENABLE, in_pass);

       // Reset variables
       in_pass = 0;
       i = 0;
     }
     else {
       Serial.println("Number must be less than or equal to 255");
       in_pass = 0;
       i = 0;
     }
  }
  }
}
```
